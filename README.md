The way this app works is that it comes up with a random number at the start of each game and assigns each crystal it's own random number that is not known by the player. The player needs to utilize the 4 crystals to try to reach the target number on the dot. It records wins and losses.

# How To Play
You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
